# Augmenting Knee Rehabilitation Replays Using MediaPipe Pose Estimation

## Overview
This project implements a methodology for analysing knee angles from video footage using MediaPipe Pose estimation. It provides near real-time visualisation $${\large\color{dodgerblue}&#x24D8; }$$  and analysis of knee movements, supporting both front-view and side-view perspectives.  

> [!NOTE]
> Near real-time visualisation of MP4 videos depends on the computer specification. <br/>
> <ins>Hint</ins>: If using a decade old laptop for fast scrolling and A-B sequence analysis, consider capturing first a screen cast of the generated augmented video replay.
> 
> As a stand-alone application, this source code is the second part of the three stage processing workflow, which is also a part of it's parent project codebase [^1] intended for home use and advancements of near-future analytical healthcare systems.

## Features
- Near real-time knee angle detection and measurement
- Support for both left and right knee analysis
- Front-view and side-view analysis capabilities
- CSV export of tracking data
- Real-time visualization with angle plots
- Incorrect knee movement detection

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation
If running the project on a computer with Python and OpenCV installed, install Google MediaPipe by:
```bash
pip install mediapipe
```
or by preparing your own `requirements.txt` for project deployments on multiple machines of similar specifications:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To run this application, at `Windows` Command Prompt, or in `MacOS`/`Linux` Terminal, use the following sytax:
``` 
python main.py video_file output_csv [--export_knee {left,right,both}] [--direction {left,right,forward}]

Arguments
video_file: Path to input video file
output_csv: Path for output CSV file
--export_knee: Specify which knee to analyze (default: both)
--direction: Override foot direction detection
```
